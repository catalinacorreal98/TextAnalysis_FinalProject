# TextAnalysis_FinalProject  ðŸš€ðŸ“ˆðŸ˜„ðŸ˜­
This work seeks to explore if high-frequency data from text analysis of national news can help predict the behavior of economic and financial indicators with a smaller lag compared to current indicators. Using a distilled version of the RoBERTa base model, sentiment analysis was performed on 3,000 news articles to calculate their negative, neutral, and positive sentiment scores. A share of negative and positive news was then derived from these scores to analyze their correlation with financial indicators (S&P 500, VIX) and economic indicators (unemployment rate, industrial production, GDP) to evaluate their potential as predictive tools.
